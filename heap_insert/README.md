Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are allowed to use the standard library
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo (if you do we won't take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
Don't forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
More Info
Data structures
Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Don't forget to include them in your header file.

Basic Binary Tree
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};
Max Binary Heap
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
Print function
To match the examples in the tasks, you are given this function

This function is used only for visualisation purpose. You don't have to push it to your repo. It may not be used during the correction

Tasks
0. New node
Write a function that creates a binary tree node:

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
value is the value to put in the new node
When created, a node does not have any children
Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure
